Dear Mr. Harry Potter
As the Principal of the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry it is my sad duty to inform
you that forthwith all owls will have to be housed in a barn, be they used for correspondence or
kept as pets.
I understand that students may have become emotionally attached to their owls, I have
observed you often with Hedwig, but unfortunately the magic mice have been disappearing
steadily.
If you have any concerns, please Department of Magical Creatures on 1 800 666 666.
Yours sincerely,

Albus Dumbledore
Principal of Hogwarts
TMP-MG-03
